📄 Document Scanner
A high-accuracy document scanning tool powered by Python and OpenCV. This project automatically detects document boundaries in an image, applies a perspective transformation, and enhances the result to produce a clean, top-down "scanned" version of the document — simulating the functionality of a traditional scanner.
✨ Key Features
* 📐 Automatic Edge Detection – Identifies document boundaries using contour analysis.

* 🔄 Perspective Correction – Transforms skewed documents into flat, readable scans.

* 🎚 Image Enhancement – Converts images to high-contrast grayscale for clarity.

* 📄 Extensible Architecture – Designed to support future additions like OCR or PDF export.
⚙️ Setup Instructions
🔧 Prerequisites
   * Python 3.7+

   * pip

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocumentScanner.git
cd DocumentScanner






Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is missing, install individually:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy imutils

🚀 Usage
Update the path to your document image inside main.py:
python
CopyEdit
image_path = "path/to/your/document.jpg"


Run the scanner:
bash
python main.py


The output will be saved as scanned_output.jpg.

🧠 How It Works
      1. Preprocessing

         * Resize and convert image to grayscale

         * Apply Gaussian blur and detect edges (Canny)

            2. Document Detection

               * Sort contours by area

               * Identify a contour with 4 points (assumed to be the document)

                  3. Perspective Transformation

                     * Warp the image to a top-down perspective using the detected points

                        4. Postprocessing

                           * Convert to grayscale

                           * (Optionally) Apply adaptive thresholding for a printed-paper look

🛣️ Roadmap
                              * ✅ Initial edge detection & transformation

                              * 🔜 OCR integration for text extraction

                              * 🔜 Multi-page scanning

                              * 🔜 Save as PDF

                              * 🔜 GUI or web interface
